# Project Memory

## Project Overview
- **Name**: SPOKES Employability Skills Curriculum
- **Description**: 6 self-contained interactive HTML lesson decks + dashboard launcher, validated against SPOKES-STANDARD.md; plus BeSpoke, the instructor visual-design wizard for the next 6 lessons
- **Tech stack**: Static HTML/CSS/JS (one index.html per lesson), Python validator/tooling, no build step. BeSpoke: static wizard on GitHub Pages + Netlify function (Node 22) for shared Save/Open/Send. Node only for tests (Playwright, axe-core)
- **Repo**: origin = doclegg05/Curriculum-Employability-Skills (dev); publisher = SPOKES-Skills/Employability-Skills-Curriculum (public Pages); t9 = /Volumes/T9 backup mirror

## Current Status
- **BeSpoke v2 builder + Guide me merged to `main` 2026-10-01** (PR #36, merge `7d482d2`). The 3-stage builder (Start, Slide designs, Review & save) replaces the 10-step wizard; the old wizard stays at `bespoke/legacy.html`. Saved designs are `bespoke-selection/v2`; v1 drafts open converted, with the original kept inside. Netlify service redeployed from `8fa1e5b` before the merge (deploy `6abe7363c429c582590174ac`); OPTIONS 204 and bogus-code 403 checked. Rules: `docs/bespoke/decisions.md`. Live on Pages since 2026-10-01 (`4dfba98`): every Pages build from 2026-09-23 had failed on Liquid in the Plan 1 doc until PR #38 (`_config.yml` excludes `docs/superpowers/`). Checked: `/bespoke/` and `/bespoke/legacy.html` return 200, Guide me opens, no console errors. Hosted v2 save/reopen/Send not yet exercised.
(as of 2026-10-01, `origin/main` = `7d482d2`)
- **Six existing lessons: OUT OF QA, READY FOR TEACHING** (Britt, 2026-09-23). This supersedes the 2026-09-22 review's "no blanket teaching release" verdict. Registry, Dashboard fallback, README and Project Plan updated to match the same day.
- **BeSpoke: built, deployed, live-verified 2026-09-22** (`docs/bespoke/verification-2026-09-22.md`). Private per-lesson team links, encrypted shared Save/Open, History, Download/Open backup, Send to Britt → receipt-confirmed draft PR. Scope is visual design only (colors, fonts, layouts, cards); no lesson is built by it.
- **BeSpoke design brief + UI rework live 2026-09-23** (PR #25, merged `3b5ea01`; Pages deployed; Netlify service `6ab3ebad54816f0e2b364fa9`). Teams answer four questions and get a starting design of their own. Live save of a design *with* a brief not yet exercised.
- **Moving to Phase 2 (Round 2): the next six lessons** — Goal Setting, Money Management (Budget), Professionalism and Diversity, Knowing Your Rights in the Workplace, Communicating Assertively, Workplace Ethics. Unbuilt; March 2027 soft target. Building needs separate Britt authorization + complete approved content.
- **BeSpoke preview fidelity fixes live 2026-09-23** (PRs #27–#31): every option in every design step now visibly changes the preview (guarded by a browser sweep). Color lead and background open on the content slide; title slides use the template's real markup with library px/rem scaled to the frame; per-chapter cards have a chapter picker.
- **Theme library fixed 2026-09-23** (PR #28): download-button AA contrast for every lead; Split Hero, Diagonal Split and the title rule repaired. Guards: `scripts/test_bespoke_theme_contrast.py`, `scripts/check-title-layouts.mjs` (both in quality.sh).
- **Slide-builder Plan 1 (2026-09-23) is superseded, never built.** The Codex builder (Sept 24 to 30) took its place with its own model (`bespoke/builder-model.mjs`, `bespoke/builder-catalog.json`). `role-components.json` / `design-model.mjs` will not exist; `docs/bespoke/slide-builder-spec.md` and Plan 1 are history only.
- Quality gate green on PR #36 head `8fa1e5b`, locally and in CI (2026-10-01).

## Last Session
- **Date**: 2026-10-01
- **What we worked on**: Checked how far the last BeSpoke plan got. Guide me (Sept 30 plan) was complete and merged into `codex/bespoke-guided-builder` (PR #35), not `main`. Ran `quality.sh` on that branch head (green), opened PR #36 to `main` with the deploy order first, staged the service at `~/bespoke-stages/2026-10-01-builder-8fa1e5b` (byte-matched the branch, v1 fixture accepted), Britt deployed it, Claude ran the post-deploy checks, CI passed, Britt merged.
- **What we decided**: see the 2026-10-01 rows in the decision log.
- **Where we left off**: v2 builder is live on Pages after PR #38 fixed a Pages build that had failed since 2026-09-23. PR #39 (three Guide me bug fixes) is open. Next: hosted round trip with a real team link (v2 design, a Guide me design, and an old v1 draft), then the Money Management pilot.

## Open Items
- [x] Guided mode and the Codex builder merged to `main` 2026-10-01 (PR #36), after the service redeploy.
- [x] PR #38 merged 2026-10-01; Pages deployed `4dfba98` and the builder is live.
- [ ] Merge PR #39: Guide me Undo after restart, thumbnail resizing, guide cleared when the design is replaced. The phone layout minor from #35 is still open (shell layout, Britt's call).
- [ ] **Hosted v2 round trip** with a private team link: build, Save, reopen on another computer, Send; confirm the draft PR carries the v2 selection, CSS and contract. Repeat with a Guide me design and with an existing v1 draft (conversion). Record in a dated verification note.
- [ ] **Guided mode pilot**: a real spokesperson runs Guide me on Money Management; hosted save, reopen and Send with a guided design have not been exercised.
- [ ] Deferred minors from the 2026-09-30 review, (a) to (c) fixed in PR #39: (a) Undo after "Start the guide again" stores a question index, not an id, and can land one question off; (b) thumbnails are scaled once per render, so narrowing the window leaves them overflowing until the next render; (c) `resetDesignForLesson` keeps the guide when the lesson id is unchanged, so opening a team with no shared design leaves the guide over a default design.
- [ ] **Preview width finding**: at 1440 px the preview is 752 px wide and the Across and Balanced grid box layouts render identically (free editor too). Britt's call whether to widen the preview or change the layout rule.
- [ ] Phone layout: the guide question starts below the stacked header, notices and stage list (existing shell), so samples need a scroll.
- [ ] **Hosted acceptance with a design brief** (PR #25): save with a brief on one computer, reopen on another, Send, confirm the "Design brief" row. Record in a verification note like `docs/bespoke/verification-2026-09-22.md`. Service redeploy (`6ab3ebad…`) and Pages are live; only this end-to-end run is missing.
- [ ] Hosted acceptance still pending for a design that includes a brief (save → reopen elsewhere → Send → "Design brief" row).
- [x] Slide builder Plan 1 superseded by the Codex builder (see Current Status); obsolete local branch `claude/slide-builder-design-model` can be deleted.
- [ ] Library textures are 3–8% opacity (Dot Grid, Diagonal nearly invisible even full-size). Britt's call whether to strengthen them.
- [ ] Quiet Center's 64px "short rule" is stretched to 120px by the template's entrance animation; Split Hero's gold subtitle is low-contrast over the blue half (also in the released Interview Skills lesson).
- [ ] Brief traits and lesson colour cues in `bespoke/brief.js` are Claude's judgement, not teacher-tested. Watch the Money Management pilot for suggestions that feel wrong and retune there.
- [ ] **Publisher site is 46 commits behind** (stuck at Aug 17 `fb9e202`). Britt to decide whether BeSpoke belongs on the public site before `git push publisher main:main`. Two live Pages sites still exist; canonical URL undecided.
- [x] **BeSpoke autosave + close warning** shipped 2026-09-23 (PR #23, merged `0212c39`, live on Pages): shared save on step change (1.5 s) and after 30 s idle; beforeunload prompt while changes are unshared; paused after opening a backup/older version until a manual Save; conflicts still stop it. 24 browser scenarios pass; quality.sh green. Live only after merge + Pages deploy.
- [ ] BeSpoke service PAT (`BESPOKE_GITHUB_TOKEN`) expires ~2026-12-20 (90 days from 2026-09-21). Google Calendar reminders set for 2026-12-06 and 2026-12-17 with rotation steps. After renewing: keep BESPOKE_DRAFT_KEY/TEAM_KEYS, verify Open+Save, move reminders to the new expiry.
- [ ] **Money Management BeSpoke pilot** with a beginner spokesperson, now on the v2 builder: open, edit, save, reopen, send. Actual Teams/tenant behaviour never exercised.
- [ ] Close the old-wizard Money Management proposal PRs #14 and #15 (v1, Sept 19 and 21) once Britt agrees.
- [ ] **13 content findings from 09-22 review** — confirm with Britt whether these were resolved or accepted as part of the ready decision (e.g. Interview Skills overwork example + AI-dependent grading; Employee Accountability 7-vs-"15" habits and 120-pt rubric; Controlling Anger unsafe assessment guidance/stale guide; Problem Solving survival-exercise inconsistency). Not software work; do not silently rewrite.
- [x] Synced to the 2026-09-23 "all six ready" decision: registry v1.3.0 (3 lessons qa→ready, pending gates→pass, dated note on all six), Dashboard FALLBACK_LESSONS + sync date, README status, SPOKES-Project-Plan header/summary (flags that its old "Phase 2: Pipeline" ≠ program Phase 2). quality.sh passed after.
- [x] Project `CLAUDE.md` reworded: 09-22 review is earlier evidence, not open release blockers.
- [ ] Britt-only approval is not enforced: `main` requires `quality` check but `required_pull_request_reviews` is null. Settings change is Britt's call.
- [ ] BeSpoke library: `gradient-fill` cards and `split-panel` dividers blocked pending contrast/watermark repairs.
- [x] Library download-button contrast fixed 2026-09-23 (PR #28): royal ink on the green and gold leads; the gold hover now lightens to `--gold`; the template default is white on `--primary`; the template hover no longer forces green. Guarded by `scripts/test_bespoke_theme_contrast.py` (every lead, rest + hover, ≥4.5:1).
- [ ] Released lessons keep their own button CSS (white on `--accent`, hover forced to accent), so the library fix does not reach them. Affected at minimum: Employee Accountability, Problem Solving, Communicating with the Public, and Time Management's default. Britt's call whether to patch released decks.
- [ ] Expected WARNs to eventually fix: interview-skills CMP-01/02 + NAV-11/12 (qa-* classes), employee-accountability NAV-11 (showTab signature); EA announcer omits "Slide X of Y" (NAV-04 divergence).
- [ ] Dashboard (kept original design 2026-08-05; **do not re-propose unifying card art** — Britt values the six distinct images). Still open: (a) grouping/wayfinding for 18 modules needs a `group`/`track` registry field — Britt's product call; (b) ragged 4+2 last row above 1501px.
- [ ] Six rejected `Dashboard-*.html` prototypes + 3 fonts only they use (archivo, public-sans, schibsted-grotesk) still committed. Britt asked once, no answer — ask again before deleting.
- [ ] Registry `slides`/`videos` fields: regenerate when decks change; FALLBACK_LESSONS in Dashboard.html must stay in sync (checked by `check-registry-sync.py`).
- [ ] Critique items deliberately NOT actioned (locked nav engine/base CSS): chapter-header click force-navigates; playClickSound + reveal-item dead code; bounce easing on takeaway-num; sidebar/progress/slide-list layout transitions. Parked design questions: WIPPEA badges student-facing, iceberg metaphor as real visual, emotional-arc chapter theming.
- [ ] Consider running the CA polish patterns over the other 5 decks (invisible h3 on light panels, text-on-gold contrast, mobile flip-card flex collapse, square photos in circles).
- [ ] PDF generators (generate_teachers_guides.py, generate_presenter_notes.py) are Windows-only; teachers-guide script has ~1,400 lines of shadowed dead code.
- [ ] ~9.5 MB unreferenced ppt-inspiration images in communicating-with-the-public; image1.png is 10.5 MB unoptimized.
- [ ] Consider Git LFS / external hosting for ~350 MB of videos (24 MP4s committed directly).
- [ ] Governance doc sprawl: SPOKES-Project-Plan, Master-Action-Plan, Agent-Execution-Spec, Agent-Runbook + `conductor/` overlap. Candidate for consolidation.

## Key Decisions Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-10-01 | Merge the Codex v2 builder (with Guide me) to `main`, replacing the wizard | Britt's call after the status review; quality gate green on the exact commit |
| 2026-10-01 | Redeploy the Netlify service from the PR head before merging | The service bundles the v2 schema and model; the new service still accepts v1, so the old wizard kept working in between |
| 2026-09-30 | Extend the Codex builder with an optional Guide me walk-through; do not build our own 8-step wizard, role model or palette | The Codex builder already had roles, history and a 3-stage flow chosen by a 2026-09-24 review; a parallel model would collide on file names and data shape |
| 2026-09-30 | Contrast stays advisory (no switched-off options); the guide shows a plain warning with the ratio | Matches the existing docs, schema and "no disabled swatches" decision; needs no schema or service change |
| 2026-09-30 | The guide's readability notes come from the model's own advisory, not a separate calculation | A separate calculation disagreed with the preview on textures and band dividers |
| 2026-09-30 | Text boxes ask the number of boxes before layout; video gets no body-text color question | Balanced grid looks like Across at the default count; video body text is hidden by default |
| 2026-09-23 | Slide builder replaces the wizard: per-role colors (mockup first), title positions, 4 slide types (chapter divider, video, bullet list, activity), accurate similarity meter | Britt: small decisions, each visible in the preview, tracked and persistent |
| 2026-09-23 | Preview must mirror the template (real markup, scaled library units) and every option must visibly change it | Britt's repeated "preview doesn't change" reports; guarded by a browser sweep |
| 2026-09-23 | BeSpoke adds a design brief step; its answers drive a starting design capped at 3–5 of 7 choices shared with any existing lesson | Presets were the six existing lessons' looks, so the default path copied a lesson |
| 2026-09-23 | Brief answers travel in an optional `brief` payload object; `variant` is a digit string | Answers must survive shared Save/Open; canonical JSON between Python and JS assumes no numeric fields |
| 2026-09-23 | For schema changes, redeploy the Netlify service before merging the wizard | The service bundles the schema and rejects unknown fields; the new service accepts old and new payloads |
| 2026-09-23 | Six Phase 1 lessons declared out of QA and ready for teaching; project moves to Phase 2 (next six lessons) | Britt's call |
| 2026-09-22 | Supervised BeSpoke pilot approved; no blanket teaching release for the 6 existing lessons | Validators pass but content/assessment findings remain; automated pass ≠ instructional approval |
| 2026-09-22 | BeSpoke teacher workflow is visual design only; Word lesson-content form removed | Britt clarified scope; content writing stays a separate process |
| 2026-09-22 | Shared Save/Open via Netlify function + encrypted drafts; OneDrive is optional backup only | File-based OneDrive handoff was too easy to mistake for durable shared work (review F1) |
| 2026-09-18 | BeSpoke prototype greenlit; locks D6–D12 in `docs/bespoke/decisions.md` | Britt greenlight after 09-17 conference briefs |
| 2026-08-05 | Dashboard keeps the card grid (canon), judged at two craft bars instead of a new visual world | Britt declined four rolled directions in a row; the form was never the problem, the execution was |
| 2026-08-05 | Card art is generated from the registry, not sourced as images | `icon`, `colorLead` and `texture` already exist per lesson; drawing from them fixes the six-unrelated-styles problem with product truth and revives the dead ICON_MAP the 22/40 critique flagged |
| 2026-08-05 | Per-lesson text colour is chosen by verified contrast, not by taste | White clears AA on blue/royal/mauve, royal ink on green/gold; this is the root fix for the critique's P1 CTA-contrast failure |
| 2026-08-03 | Registry statuses: 3 lessons "ready", 3 stay "qa" | Notes said release-approved but status stuck at qa; dashboard showed "0 Ready" |
| 2026-08-03 | Hook lives in .claude/settings.json (shared), not settings.local.json | Local file is per-machine; hook is team infrastructure |
| 2026-08-03 | Validator WARNs surface real divergences instead of auto-passing | Perfect 68/0/0 scores were partly hardcoded; honesty over optics |
| 2026-08-03 | big-rocks.vtt gets music-descriptor cues, not speech captions | Video verified music-only with on-screen text (whiteboard animation) |
| 2026-08-03 | Classroom type scale: 19px root font at ≥1600×920, per deck | Britt found content too small at 1920×1080; decks are rem-based so one lever scales all; scoped to avoid the ≤900px fit-guard |
| 2026-08-03 | Scale/override blocks go at the END of theme-override | Media queries don't add specificity; later same-specificity rules silently win — bit us twice (CWP icons, PSDM closing h2) |

## Architecture Notes
- TWO GitHub repos, one history: publisher (`SPOKES-Skills/Employability-Skills-Curriculum`) is the public home + Pages site; origin (`doclegg05/...`) is the dev repo and the one that moves. Publisher carries no unique commits — catching up is `git push publisher main:main`. Both public; dev repo ALSO serves Pages.
- **BeSpoke**: v2 builder in `bespoke/` (`index.html`, `builder-app.mjs`, `builder-model.mjs`, `builder-catalog.json`, Guide me in `bespoke/guide/`; old wizard at `legacy.html`; GitHub Pages `/bespoke/`); service in `netlify/functions/bespoke-handoff.mjs` (site `spokes-bespoke`, publishes only `netlify/site`). Drafts encrypted on the `bespoke-drafts` branch; separate encryption key survives GitHub token rotation. Send → Spoke Signals Action (`.github/workflows/spoke-signals.yml`) → draft PR with selection, generated CSS, build contract. Proposals are PUBLIC (public repo); UI discloses this.
- BeSpoke catalog/library: `SPOKES Builder/bespoke-library-catalog.json`, `theme-library.css`, `theme-options.json`; schema generated by `scripts/generate-selection-schema.py` (`--check` in CI). Builder procedure: `docs/bespoke/builder-handoff.md`; admin/provisioning: `docs/bespoke/auto-handoff-setup.md`.
- BeSpoke service deploys are staged by Claude and run by Britt (Netlify CLI). The site ID, command and post-deploy checks live in Claude's private auto-memory (`bespoke-netlify-deploy`). The service bundles the schema, so deploy it before merging any schema change.
- Secrets: GitHub token in macOS Keychain + Netlify env; private team links/provisioning files live outside the repo. Never commit or log them.
- CI: `.github/workflows/quality.yml` runs `scripts/quality.sh`; gitleaks configured (`.gitleaks.toml`).
- All fonts are self-hosted in `fonts/` (Dashboard + all six decks, latin subsets). No external origins in shipped pages. TYP-05 enforces this.
- SPOKES-STANDARD.md is the single source of truth; validator scripts/validate-lesson.py enforces it via PostToolUse hook (scripts/hooks/validate-lesson-hook.sh).
- Six-way nav-engine drift exists: only reference signature switchTab(btn,panelId) has zero live call sites; three lessons use switchTab(event,tabId); consolidation is a future upgrade.
- Dashboard.html fetches lesson-registry.json with a hardcoded FALLBACK_LESSONS array for file:// use — keep both in sync when editing the registry.

## Known Issues
- GitHub Pages runs Jekyll, so Liquid parses every `.md` file. A doc quoting `{{` breaks the whole Pages build, and nothing in `quality.sh` catches it. PR #38 excludes `docs/superpowers/`; other `.md` paths are still exposed.
- UNVERIFIED: Chrome may block `<track>` caption files over file:// (per-file opaque origins). Captions confirmed fine over http. Spot-check before promising captions on the double-click path.
- Two live Pages sites (publisher + dev repo), and they have diverged (publisher 46 commits behind as of 2026-09-23).
- a11y ratchet in quality.sh permits existing baseline violations — green gate is not a clean accessibility bill of health. Verification record flags lesson readability scores "below grade 8" as a caveat (wording ambiguous; check `readability-gate.mjs` output before citing).
- Not exercised anywhere: real Teams meetings, tenant permissions, OneDrive sync conflicts, every caption vs audio, every PDF page, every style combination.
