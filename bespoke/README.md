# BeSpoke

BeSpoke helps instructor teams choose a presentation's visual design through small
choices and a cumulative preview. It configures reusable title, chapter-divider,
text-box, video and activity designs with sample copy. It does not write curriculum,
build a complete deck, or publish lessons.

**October 7, 2026 status:** the simplified workflow is implemented for local
review in an isolated worktree. Synthetic local saving is separate from hosted
acceptance; this revision has not been merged or deployed.

## Name the team, pick a look, make it yours, send

BeSpoke opens on **Lesson & team**. Choose the lesson, name the team and enter the
spokesperson's name and email. The stage pill stays marked until the team is
identified. A team enters its code before it can leave this stage, and Send to Britt needs the
spokesperson's name.

1. **Pick a look:** a large stage shows the current look, with its name, layout,
   fonts and colors beside it. Under it, a filmstrip holds the twelve looks, filtered
   by mood chips (All 12, Calm, Bold, Bright, Classic). Every render uses the lesson's
   name as its title until the team types their own. Hovering or focusing a look
   previews it on the stage; clicking it or pressing Enter applies it as one Undo step.
   **Make it ours** moves on to Make it yours. **Build my own** and **Guide me** sit at
   the end of the mood row, and a **Your design** card brings back the team's own design.
2. **Make it yours:** click visible text in the large slide, or pick it from **Editing**.
   A toolbar band above the slide holds its options, and **More options** opens the
   Slide options drawer. Edit the words in the nearby Sample text field. Choose a text color, one of three
   sizes, Left/Center/Right alignment, and Top/Middle/Bottom placement within the
   text area. A continuous typing session is one Undo action. **Add text** adds one
   additional editable text area per slide type; select it again to edit or remove it.
   Existing box headings and bodies can be edited separately. One line under the
   toolbar names the other slides a color change reaches, and their rail thumbnails
   carry a **changed** tag. A line at the top reads "Starting from <look> · N changes".
3. **Send:** the five slides sit on one sheet beside a summary of the look, its fonts
   and the team's changes, the notes field, **Save for the team** and **Send to Britt**.
   **See every setting** holds the full per-slide review. Saving remains a
   visual-design review workflow.

Select Background for **Solid** (one brand-color picker) or **Gradient**
(independent start and end brand-color pickers). Changes appear immediately.
The preset supplies the direction; no direction choice is shown. Solid retains
its second color for later use. The eleven established brand colors remain available.

Undo and Redo remain beside the four stages. **More options** retains the detailed
slide choices and shared theme, without requiring a team to work through them.
The original v1 wizard remains separate at `legacy.html`.

A look fills the same controls as individual editing. Changing a field keeps
the other choices. Applying another look replaces the visual choices and keeps
sample text. There is no confirmation dialog: the apply is one Undo step, and the
**Undo** link beside Make it ours takes it back.

**Shared theme** is an optional disclosure in the Slide options drawer and in Send's
**See every setting**. It contains
the shared colors, heading/body fonts and background detail, including Sidebar, Accent and
Buttons colors. These three colors have no local slide replacement; shared body
typography also supplies navigation and buttons. Shared content background still
supplies the lesson canvas and the exterior of a Band divider.

Each inheritable slide field is marked **Shared** or **Custom**. Shared fields
follow the corresponding current default; custom fields stay unchanged when that
default changes. **Use shared theme** restores inheritance for that field on that
slide type, keeping its other fields and the other slide designs. The effective
summary in See every setting reports each slide's resolved choices instead of describing shared
font defaults as though every slide used them.

**Colors:** select an element, then a brand swatch to replace its color immediately.
All eleven swatches stay visible, including White. Colors are assigned directly to
sidebar, title background and its second color, title text, subtitle, content
background, headings, body, accent, buttons and divider background. The sidebar
text color is Automatic unless the Team Leader picks one. There is no
preselected two-primary/three-secondary palette. All eleven colors, including Gold
and Green, are selectable for every text and background role. Low-contrast combinations show an advisory, never a veto or hidden
recoloring. Contrast is the difference between text and its background; low contrast
can make text harder to read. The warning gives the actual modeled ratio and the
3:1 heading or 4.5:1 supporting/body-text guideline. The team leader can keep the choice. Decorative
accents and text are separate roles. Selecting Buttons keeps the current preview
and shows a temporary action-button sample when that slide has no button. On phones,
the same sample also appears beside the palette. Video and Activity use their own
sample buttons. Every sample uses the selected button color with automatically chosen
legible text; sample activation does not navigate, download or submit.

**Divider text:** Title & divider headings controls both large title lettering and
chapter headings. Subtitle & divider supporting text controls the title subtitle,
copyright, chapter label and divider supporting copy. Content headings/body remain
independent. Shared theme exposes these shared choices and the gradient's shared
second color. The Chapter divider editor can override its own fields. Painting a
divider background preserves all selected text colors;
contrast advisories offer optional color alternatives without blocking shared saves
or generated output. Existing files and shared revisions retain their original values.
Structural, schema, access and conflict checks still apply. Generated contracts and
sample HTML carry the same nonblocking advisories. These warnings remain visible
even when the separate preset-confirmation opt-out is enabled.

**Fonts:** choose heading/title and body fonts independently from all twelve existing
self-hosted families. The six former pairings remain available through their font
families; presets can initialize combinations, but do not lock a pairing. Franklin
Gothic Book is omitted because no existing licensed webfont package was found. Its
absence does not block the builder, and no substitute is labeled as that font.

**Background detail:** Plain, Color block, Edge rail and Frame supply the shared
detail for all five slide types. A custom slide detail stays independent.
Each shared control shows a miniature on the current preview's base color. Color block,
Edge rail and Frame are solid shapes in a single color that stay inside the slide's outer
margin, so they never sit under text. The color is the accent when it stands apart from the
slide's base colors, otherwise White or Royal, chosen for visibility without changing saved
color roles. Text boxes keep their chosen opaque reading surface. Title/divider readability
checks include the detail and gradient layers. Plain removes the detail while keeping the
selected base color, gradient or band layout. Preview and generated output share the
same treatment. Designs saved with Dot grid, Diagonal, Crosshatch or Soft wash open as
Plain; the schema and the service still accept those ids.

**Components:** title and divider designs have separate optional arrangement and
appearance choices. Text boxes support one to four boxes, one optional shared
title bar, paragraph/bullet/numbered treatment, box style and arrangement. Video
and activity have their own controls. Reducing the box count keeps all four draft
strings so increasing it restores the hidden text. The live preview uses the same
accumulated design used by backups, shared saves and generated artifacts.

**Title arrangements:** the preview uses a 16:9 canvas with a 420px minimum height,
and grows for long sample copy. Centered centers the text; Left aligned keeps the
same vertical grouping at the left; Bottom left moves the group down. Split panels
places the text in a separate right column with a visible panel boundary, retaining
the selected solid/gradient finish and background detail. Above the title keeps the logo with
the text group; Top corner anchors it independently. Type scales with the canvas
width rather than the browser window. These semantics also apply to generated
samples and canonical title CSS. The existing title controls stay in place.

**Video frames:** Plain removes the frame. Accent frame uses the chosen accent
with thin White or Royal separating lines, so it stays visible when the accent,
video placeholder and slide background match. The separator is decorative; saved
color choices are unchanged. The frame fits inside the same responsive 16:9 box
in the preview, generated sample and canonical video/iframe wrapper. Samples stay
inert and never load media.

**Comparison:** one line on Send reads "Shares X of Y choices with the released
lessons". It counts exact matching measured choices against six actual
presentations: Time Management, Interview Skills, Controlling Anger,
Employee Accountability, Communicating with the Public, and Problem Solving &
Decision Making. It includes comparable font, color, background, layout and component
characteristics. Details show matches, differences and unknown features. Unknown or
mixed measurements do not count as matches. The count is not a pixel or perceptual
similarity percentage, does not block a choice, and knows nothing about other teams'
private designs. Preset cards show their closest measured reference; another preset
or individual edits can provide a more distinct starting point without a uniqueness
guarantee.

## Guide me

On Pick a look, **Guide me** sits at the end of the mood row. The guide asks one question per
screen, slide by slide: a starting look, a shared look (fonts, background detail, sidebar, accent and
button colors), then the title slide, chapter divider, text boxes, video slide and activity.
Each question shows its choices as small pictures drawn from the real slide styles, and
pointing at one previews it without choosing it. Color questions suggest the four most
readable colors on the current background and keep all eleven one click away. Readability
stays advisory. Every question can be skipped with **Next**, a whole slide type can be
skipped, and the guide can be left and resumed. After each slide type a recap shows the
choices, with a link back to any question. The guide writes the same saved design the free
editor writes, so nothing about saving, opening or sending changes. Undo also returns the
guide to the question where the change was made. The guide's position is kept in the
browser draft only. The code is in `guide/`; `test-bespoke-guide.mjs` and
`test-bespoke-guided-browser.mjs` check it.

## Drafts, recovery and shared work

Forward/back navigation and switching preview roles keep the design. Undo/redo
tracks recent design changes in the browser draft. Refresh restores that draft;
downloaded backups preserve the selection and its hidden sample strings. A browser
copy or downloaded backup is not a confirmed shared save.

The connected workflow retains private team access, shared Save/Open, revision
checks, history, retry protection and receipt-confirmed Send. One builder operates
the design during a team call while the team decides together. When the builder is
not the Team Leader, the saved design names them in `team.builder.name`. Shared autosave runs shortly after stage
changes and after 30 seconds without a change; immediate Save is available. A failed, stale or
pending save remains visible. Restored backups and earlier versions require explicit
Save before shared autosave resumes. A stale revision is rejected rather than
replacing another computer's newer design. Keep a backup, open the latest shared
version, and recover the choices the team agrees to keep.

A v1 backup opens as an **explained conversion**, not a promise of identical
appearance. The exact source selection remains in `legacySelection` in every v2
backup and can be downloaded separately on Send. Older title/divider/card options
may have no exact equivalent; chapter-specific styling remains in that original
backup. Review conversion and readability notes before saving the new design. The
original wizard remains at `bespoke/legacy.html`; its storage keys are separate.

For the deployed workflow, each team has a private team code and a team view link.
The code, kept in the team's OneDrive folder, grants real edit access; the one
builder types it in **Open your team design**. The team view link is pinned in the team's channel and always opens the latest saved design
read-only. It leaves out the Team Leader's email, the review notes and any older
wizard design kept for recovery. **Leave session** removes
remembered access and local drafts, not shared work. A snapshot link made by the
original wizard still opens read-only, does not follow later saves, and can
contain readable sample text and contact details. Review proposals are public
repository artifacts; use work contact details and non-sensitive sample copy.

**Send to Britt** uses the confirmed saved selection. Processing is not delivery;
only the matching proposal receipt establishes that Britt received the review
request. Then Send shows the **Sent to Britt** view, or another stage shows the toast
**Sent to Britt.** Local preview disables Send and receipt-status requests completely.

## Local review

For this simplified-workflow worktree, use port **8778** and runtime directory
`~/Library/Application Support/Codex/local-previews/bespoke-simple-layouts`.

Use HTTP so catalogs and fonts load. A `file://` preview cannot load the wizard's
catalogs. From this isolated worktree:

```sh
node scripts/bespoke-dev-server.mjs --port 8778 \
  --runtime-dir "/Users/brittlegg/Library/Application Support/Codex/local-previews/bespoke-simple-layouts"
```

Open [the local builder](http://127.0.0.1:8778/bespoke/). The server binds only to
loopback and overrides the handoff configuration with its own synthetic draft
service. **Save test design**, Open and history use only local test data, with the
same revision and retry handler. No real team code or hosted-service connection is
needed. The external runtime directory keeps these drafts across server restarts;
omitting `--runtime-dir` keeps them only in memory. Do not place runtime data in
MacDev or another Git checkout. Stop the foreground server with Ctrl-C.

Port 8778 is separate from the earlier previews at 8765, 8766 and 8767.
Keep those servers and browser drafts intact while reviewing this workflow.
Local testing does not establish online multi-device or hosted delivery acceptance.

Node.js 22+ is required for v2 validation/artifact generation. The proposal writer
produces the full selection, canonical content intake, CSS, v2 build contract and
reusable component samples. Its checker verifies actual box count, title-bar
presence and paragraph/list markup; matching CSS alone cannot implement structural
choices. See [builder handoff](../docs/bespoke/builder-handoff.md).

V2 cannot be flattened into the legacy v1 theme registry. Registry application
fails explicitly until there is a reviewed v2 consumer. That limitation does not
prevent choosing, saving or reviewing a v2 visual design. A lesson build and
publication still require separate authorization and approved instructor content.
The six previously approved Phase 1 releases are not reopened by this work.

Before a hosted rollout, deploy the compatible service authority/schema/model and
verify hosted acceptance before exposing v2 writes to teams. Follow
[shared service setup](../docs/bespoke/auto-handoff-setup.md); never put credentials
in browser assets or repository files. This local implementation did not perform
a deployment or change production configuration.

## Checks and historical references

```sh
node scripts/test-bespoke-simple-workflow.mjs
node scripts/generate-selection-v2-schema.mjs --check
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_bespoke*.py' -v
node --test scripts/test-bespoke-handoff.mjs scripts/test-bespoke-v2-contracts.mjs scripts/test-bespoke-dev-server.mjs
bash scripts/quality.sh
```

These are verification commands, not a claim that every gate has passed. The
current implementation's evidence belongs in its dated verification report.
Read [decisions](../docs/bespoke/decisions.md) for the September 24 overrides. The
September 23 slide-builder specification and color mockup remain historical design
records; their restricted palette, fixed pairing and no-preset constraints are
superseded. The [team meeting guide](team-guide.html) describes the four-stage
builder, optional editors, shared defaults and recovery. The original wizard is
preserved separately; its historical sequence is not the current builder's flow.
