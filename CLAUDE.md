# SPOKES Curriculum — Agent Instructions

## Required Reading

Before creating or modifying any lesson, you MUST read `SPOKES-STANDARD.md` in full.
Violations of CRITICAL rules will be caught by automated hooks and block your work.

## File Organization Standards

- Never nest files or folders more than 3 levels deep from the project root.
  - OK: `project/category/file.md`
  - OK: `project/category/subcategory/file.md`
  - NOT OK: `project/category/subcategory/deep/file.md`
- When creating new files or directories, check current depth first and flatten the structure if needed.

## Lesson Modification Rules

- Never modify the navigation engine directly — it is defined in SPOKES-STANDARD.md Section 5.
- All interactive components must meet accessibility requirements in SPOKES-STANDARD.md Section 3.
- All videos must have caption tracks (A11Y-07).
- The validator (`scripts/validate-lesson.py`) runs automatically on every Write/Edit to `lesson-*/index.html`.
- Fix all CRITICAL failures before proceeding — the hook will block until they are resolved.

## Build Process

For building new lessons, see `SPOKES Builder/CLAUDE.md` for the step-by-step build workflow.
The design rules referenced there are defined in `SPOKES-STANDARD.md`.

## Conference design briefs (capture only)

Read these before changing Round 2 modules or the Builder intake. Do not ship product from them without Britt go.

- `docs/phase-2/money-management-tanf-snap-topics-2026-09-17.md` — Money Management — Budget topic map (Britt's team)
- `docs/briefs/instructor-to-html-intake-2026-09-17.md` — KEEP VERBATIM intake rules on top of `SPOKES Builder/content-intake-template.md`
- `docs/briefs/instructor-lesson-studio-concept-2026-09-17.md` — historical Bespoke concept. The prototype was subsequently greenlit; current locks are in `docs/bespoke/decisions.md`.

This package is not VisionQuest. Do not merge SPOKES HTML hosting into the VisionQuest deploy path.

## BeSpoke foundation and review

- Read `docs/bespoke/builder-handoff.md` for saved-design proposals, optional backup-file intake, approval boundaries, generated design contracts and final-output checks.
- The instructor BeSpoke workflow covers visual choices, previews, collaboration, shared Save/Open, and design review only. Teachers open their administrator-provisioned private lesson link, pinned in their private Teams channel. One spokesperson operates the preview during a call; OneDrive is optional backup storage, not the shared-save service. Teachers use `bespoke/team-guide.html`; no content-authoring form or completed lesson is required.
- Read `docs/bespoke/auto-handoff-setup.md` for access provisioning, independent draft encryption, the staged Netlify service deployment, and hosted acceptance checks. Keep all private links and secrets out of repository files and logs. Do not describe shared Save/Open/Send as live or accepted without deployed test evidence.
- A review request is received only when the matching proposal receipt is confirmed. Design approval does not authorize lesson construction; a later build needs explicit authorization and complete instructor-owned content.
- Read `docs/qa-reports/project-review-2026-09-22.md` for current evidence and unresolved lesson release issues.
- The September 22 review authorized foundation fixes, not construction of the six new lessons. March 2027 is a soft phase target.
