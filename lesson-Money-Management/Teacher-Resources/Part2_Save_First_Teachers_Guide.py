SPOKES Money Management -- Part 2: Save Money Before You Spend It
Teacher's Guide for The Cushion Challenge (lesson-Money-Management/cushion-challenge.html)

Built from SPOKES Builder/Teachers_Guide_Template.py and the TeachersGuidePDF class
in generate_teachers_guides.py.

Run from anywhere:
    python lesson-Money-Management/Teacher-Resources/Part2_Save_First_Teachers_Guide.py

On a Windows machine with the standard fonts, the guide uses the same fonts as the
other SPOKES Teacher's Guides. Elsewhere it falls back to the self-hosted SPOKES fonts
(Outfit and DM Serif Display, converted from fonts/*.woff2; needs fonttools + brotli).
